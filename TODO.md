- [x] Update MainLayoutCard.tsx: Modify props to include sections (array of { label: string, key: string }), activeSection (string), and onSectionChange (function); render sections as clickable tabs/buttons in the title area instead of static h3; make title prop optional.
- [x] Update Employees.tsx: Add activeSection state; define sections array (e.g., Staff Management, Attendance); update MainLayoutCard usage with new props; conditionally render children content based on activeSection (staff UI for staff, placeholder for attendance).
